        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <h3>I live in NYC, the bronx, and I am salvadorean, which is the smallest country located in Central America. Im currently a student attending CityTech taking on the major emerging media.</h3>
        <h3>During the summer, I plan to finally finish a painting/clay project that I started and never got to finishing it, learn how to roller skate, and learn more about coding and the arduino.</h3>
        <h3>At first I became interested in computer science but I soon understood that that path was very intensive and I knew it would be too difficult for me to catch up in. So there was a moment where I didn't know in which direction to go to. It wasn't until I decided to choose my major, emerging media, was when I realized that this major would allow me to stay in touch with technology but from multiple angles.</h3>

        <h2>What I want to do</h2>
        <h3>As for future goals, I'm keeping an openmind about the different concentrations the major has to offer, but right now physical computing is catching my interest because I enjoy the hands on aspect of it. </h3>
        <h3>I really want to immerse myself into the creative aspect of technology. </h3>
        <h3>Whether it'd be in photoshop, creating physical prototypes, web development, or editing, I'm still keeping an openmind about what I want to do. </h3>
